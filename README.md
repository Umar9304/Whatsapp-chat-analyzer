NOTE: the regular expresion used in my code is for txt formate:
 - day/month/year(last 2 digit), hour(12):minuteâ€¯(AM/PM) - User name: message
 - change the regular expresions based on your txt data
 - here is one for 24 hr formate :
   - pattern = '\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4},\s\d{1,2}:\d(2)\s-\s' #Change in preprocessing.py line 6
   - entry = re.split('([\w\W]+?):\s',message) #Change in preprocessing.py line 18
